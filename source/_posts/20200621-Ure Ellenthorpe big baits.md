**Big baits - sit and wait**

Went into 1st entrace, parked at the second entrance to the river.

Fished to the right (upstream) of the gate and 2 pegs before the wires.

Fished from 18:00 until 21:00. I decided to concentrate on big baits and bomb. I did not get any bites but that's fine; I was holding out for big fish.

**Escape route**
If you have read about me getting locked in on my previous visit then it may tickle you to realise that I found another road off the Ellenthorpe estate that does NOT seem to have a lockable gate!
