**Today (Mon) was lovely, Fri was not!**
I had hopped for a couple of trips to the river before the end of the season but last weeks rainfall knocked that on the head. river was 3-4M over depth.

So, despite a terrible forecast for Friday I decided on the Lake and chose a peg where the wind would be from behind me. The plan being to shelter from the rain under my brolly. The wind really picked up and was gusting from all directions so I had to take my brolly down and just put up with the rain and sever wind chill. 

The fish were not interested. I managed to very small (hand-sized) Ide and a Bream of about 2lb.

**Monday, let's try again**
There had been quite good reports from the pond over the past couple of weeks so I wondered what I had done wrong on Friday. Then, last night, I noticed a posting on Facebook that said that everyone had struggled on the Lake at the weekend due to the cool wind and rain - phew, it's not just me!

So, I didn't have great expectations today but the weather forecast was nice so I should at least have a pleasant day.

**Sun glare forced me to the feeder**
I had intended to float fish most of the day. However, the early sun was right in my face and made it very hard to see the float. I therefore decided to use the feeder until the sun moved around a bit. I did hit into a Bream on the feeder and got it half way in before I pulled out.

**Now it's float time**
Nothing else showed on the feeder. However I had continued to feed my float line so was looking forward to fishing it once the sun had moved. I wasn't long before I started getting little pulls and rises on the float. eventually I got two fish in two casts, the first being a Roach and the next being a skimmer. Not much happened for the next couple of hours.

**Shallow up a bit**
I decided to try off bottom for a while. This immediately resulted in several really small Roach and Ide. However, nothing bigger showed.

**Back on the bottom**
I went back on the bottom and managed a few bigger Roach and Ide. Then I hit into a lovely solid Bream. This was great on the light float gear and ended up being the following 5lb 8oz Bream. I really loved those gold coloured cheeks.

I tried the feeder several times on and off during the day but got nothing other than a few little knocks.
