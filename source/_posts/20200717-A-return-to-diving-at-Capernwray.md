**Diving again at last**
Today a few us were finally released from lock-down and able to dive at the Capernwary dive site. This is a quarry near Carnforth close to the Lake District. It is setup for diving and has several underwater attractions including sunken boats, light airfcraft, a passenger airliner, helicopters nice sized Roach, Perch, some sizeable Trout and some ever growing Sturgeon (largest about 6 feet long at the time of writing).

I must congratulate Capernwray on their efforts to re-open safely for diving once the lockdown measures were eased. They control the number of visitors per day, have re-organised the cafe and shop to provide social distancing and one-way routes and they have provided plenty of wipes and hand sanitizer.

It was drizzling on arrival and got heavier as we started to kit up. This was a shame as we left home in bright sunshine. It had been a while since we all dived so took a bit longer to get kitted up.

We had one dive in the morning and I was presently suprised by the visibility, particularly at the western side of the quarry. This was followed by a nice lunch we we had to eat outside due to a ban on indoor eating. Thankfully the rain had ceased so lunch was quite pleasant. We then had an afternoon dive where Nigel and I ended up diving around the entire perimiter of the quarry - quite a swim! 

We finished with a cuppa and a chat - such simple delights but oh how I have missed this kind of thing. 

I decided not to take my stills camera so that I could just enjoy the diving. I did, however, take my Go Pro and shot the following, the juvenile Sturgeon appears about 5:03 into the video.
