**Chilly & Foggy Day**
This was a fairly chilly day with fog rolling of the field and down into the river.

I presevered with worm (alternating between lobworm and dendras) then started to get afew taps. I ended up with a few medium sized Perch and a couple of nice Roach. One was exactly 1lb and was a bit battle-scarred but this one was 1lb 2oz and in prime condition.
