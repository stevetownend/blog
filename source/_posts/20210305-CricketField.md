*Level 9.8m*
**Two day roving**
Weather had been reasonable for the past few days with no real rain. Therefore the level was normal and water clarity was good. I decided to go roaming on Ings Lane Bottom on Thu 4th. I fed 3 pegs with a mixture of liquidised bread, chopped worm and bread mash. I then fished them in turn, feeding another 2 pegs once I started in the last of the 3 pegs that I had already fed. I fished each for about 30 minutes, 10 on breadflake, 10 on cheesepaste and 10 on lobworm.

I started in peg 5 and worked my way downstream. There was some unexpected rain today and it was breezy from time to time. At least the breeze dried out the effects of the rain. I had no indications until my 5th peg - just near the hawthorne bush. By the time I got there it was around 3pm. I had a few plucks on lobworm and then eventually got a hittable bite that resulted in a Perch of 2lb. No sooner had I returned it then I got another of 1lb 10oz. I decided to stay in that peg because I was getting lots of little plucks but didn't manage to hit any other bites.

I repeated the roving technique of yesterday with the same feeding pattern and 30 minutes per swim. I started in peg 2. The weather was much nicer today - no breeze and no need for gloves. However there were a lots of dogs about and I was just about to move to peg 3 when a dog launched itself in to the river at peg 3. So, I gave peg 2 an extra 10 minutes to give peg 3 a chance to settle. I had no bites in peg 2. I went to peg 3 and stared with bread, then tried cheesepaste. Finally the lobworm produced a bite that resulted in my personalm best Perch of 2lb 14oz - so close to my 3lb target. I ended up with 3 Perch from peg 3 before the bites slowed.

**Peg 5 strikes again**
I tried in peg 4, it's the first time that I have been able to fish there because it is too overgrown in summer time. So, onto peg 5 which had produced a nice bag of Perch a couple of weeks ago.

Again I tried bread and cheesepaste first in case there were any Chub around but, once again, the lobworm was the bait because the Perch were definitely on the hunt. Apparently they breed before most of our coarse fish so were feeding up before their important business. That also explains why several of them had fat bellies.

I managed a further 14 Perch, 2 of them being over 2lb. 

So, my total for the day was 17 Perch, 4 being over 2lb and one being a PB for an estimated total weight of 22lb - a really enjoyable day.
