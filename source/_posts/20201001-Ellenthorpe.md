**Recent Sessions**
For the past couple of weeks I have been focussing on the Ellenthorpe stretch. Last Friday I spent 8 hours at the Corn Dryers in a very strong wind (too gusty for the brolly) with frequent showers. The river was also up about 1.5m. It was a miserable day without a single bite.

So, my next trip focussed on Perch at the Corn Dryers. I also put out my Barbel rod with halibut pellet - just in case. Nothing on the Barbel rod but I did get quite a few Perch. I was certain that one of them would break my 3lb target as it looked huge - it turned out to be 2lb 6oz. Still a nice fish but not the catch I thought it was. I then spent a lovely evening on the stick float at the Corn Dryers in the hope of picking up Perch, perhaps Roach, Bream or Chub as I was using lobworm. However, I only managed a few smallish Perch. The weather was really nice and the river was very calming after a busy day at work.

**Tonight's session**
I nipped out for a 2 hour session after work (it gets dark so early now). I went to Ellenthorpe middle - peg 26. I fished one rod with halibut pellet and a PVA mesh bag of freebies and one rod with lobworm. Both were fished in mid river.

**My best Barbel on the Ure**
After about 45 minutes (about 6pm) I got a solid bite on the halibut pellet and had a great fight from a feisty 11lb Barbel. This equals my best ever Barbel (on the Swale about 30 years ago - yikes!). It also has a very noticable nick on it's tail fin.

I have seen a few reports of Barbel at Ellenthorpe and weighed a friend's Barbel as I arrived tonight. His was a shade under 10lb. Hopefully I have re-located the Barbel. I am expecting a plumber tomorrow, I hope he comes early so that I can go back and try for more on a longer session.
