**Patience Required**
I fished the middle lane at Ellenthorpe in the deeps (peg 25). It was a full day session with not much activity. However, the lobworm turned up trumps when I hooked into a very fit 5lb river Bream at 1pm.

Then around 2:40pm, I hooked into a hard fiting Barbel that was a real surprise. I wasn't expecting Barbel in late November.
