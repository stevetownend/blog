**A new peg for me**
I had planned to fish peg 19 as the wind was forecast to be coming from behind that pag. However, when I arrived the committee of Gary, Gary and Kevin were already there and fishing the pegs I had planned to try. However both Garys recommended peg 12 (which should also have the wind behind it).

**Waggler at close-medium range**
Last year I had a clear out and got rid of my old floats (some were probably 30 years old). I have just ordered some new ones so didn't have any heavy wagglers with me. I therefore fished about 20m out. 

**A slow start**
I fished the float for a couple of hours whilst also feeding a swim just off the island for the feeder/bomb later. I only managed a couple of small Roach and a skimmer by 11am so decided to rest the float line and try the feeder for an hour or so. I had a couple of twitches on sweetcorn but no real bites. The maggot didn't work on the feeder either.

**That's more like it**
When I went back on the waggler I immediately started getting bites. They were very shy, not managing to pull the float entirely under but started to catch small Mirror Carp that were stocked last year. I managed 4 of these stockies by lunchtime. I then put in some feed and went to see the guys whilst I had my own food.

**Enjoyable afternoon**
When I got back I continued to get those shy bites that resulted in more stockies. I also hooked a bigger Carp and almost had it in when it headed for the tree at my left hand side - I applied side-strain to turn the fish but my hook pulled out my hook ended in the tree to my right. So, I tackled up again and managed a couple more stockies before getting a 6lb Bream - no sign of spawning nodules yet.

I continued to get bites on and off all afternoon and ended up with 2 skimmers, 2 Roach, that 6lb Bream and 12 of those little stockie Mirrors.
