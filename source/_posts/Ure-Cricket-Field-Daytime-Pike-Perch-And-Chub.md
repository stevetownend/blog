**Setting the scene**
Today was forecast to be mainly overcast but dry. However it quickly became apparent that there was a lot of blue sky around. I checked the forecast again about 9am (having arrived about 7am) and it had changed to be mainly sunny - oh dear, a low, clear river with sun - not a good combination. Oh well, there are worse ways to spend a day.

I decided to fish a new peg today. It's the next proper peg along from peg 14. I think this is known as the "Barrel peg". There was an overhanging bush/tree on my left (upstream) and a large area of slack from there to as far as I could see along the nearside bank. There was also a large tree downstream of me but, due to low water levels, was too far above the water and the water was clear and shallow below it so of no use. I think this will be a day to fish to the ample bush coverage on the far bank. I have not tried this yet but the slow flow should help me hold station near those bushes and, considering the sunlight, is probably where the fish will be.

So I began with a large chunk of luncheon meat straight in front of me and close to the farside coverage. I was using a block-end swim feeder with enlarged holes to help disperse my feed of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets, micro luncheon meat cubes and micro cheese cubes. I was getting light knocks so there were definitely fish around although probably small stuff. Whilst it was still early, I decided to put my other rod into the main flow in case there were any Barbel patrolling but, to be honest, the light levels were not helping.

**First bite - a surprise!**
It wasn't too long before my farside rod get a proper bite. Not a rod-bending bite more like something had picked up my bait but was still moving along the bottom - no bolting. I struck into a solid fish that came toward me relatively easily. Not like a Barbel unless it had not woken up yet. As it got closer it then started on some hard lunges, again not like a Barbel but strong all the same. It certainly tested out my drag setting. After several lunges I got it to the surface and, low and behold, it was a decent Pike. I expected to see a Chub hanging from it's mouth but it quickly became apparent that it was hooked normally. I netted it and, sure enough, it had taken my lunchoen meat and was hooked inside the mouth. I was very lucky that it's teeth had not cut my line. I estimated it to be about 10lb as it was similar in length and girth to the 10lb Barbel I caught 3 days ago. 

I had setup my camera but, whilst trying to find a safe way to held it (they were big teeth!), the Pike flipped out of my hands and managed to get back in the river. Oh well, at least this was hooked and landed normally so I can count this as a fair catch - unlike the others that have grabbed my Chub recently. The other plus was that I had probably removed it from the farside swim which I had been baiting up. 

**Nice looking but not welcome**
Just as I was settling down after the Pike, I saw lots of streams of bubbles in front of me and then heard something surface under the bush on my left hand side. I had been loose feeding near that bush so did welcome the appearance of an Otter! After a moment or so I then saw the stream of bubbles heading to mid river from near the bush. There was more than one stream of bubbles and it wasn't long before two Otters surfaced, mid-river, right in front of me and watched me. One of then surfaced clutching a small fish. I quickly retrieved my feeder rod and made a heavy cast/splash near them in the hope of spooking them and getting them to move elsewhere.

**Time for a change**
As the sun got higher and the day heated up, I was not getting any interest mid river. I decided to try near the upstream bush on my nearside bank. When retrieving my lead/bait from there I realised it was quite shallow. The water was moving near there so I assumed it was a bit deeper but, donning my polarised sun glasses, it was only a couple of feet deep. Perhaps not so good in clear water with sunny skies.

I then decided to fish both rods to the farside coverage. I kept one on lunchean meat and alternated the other between bread flake and cheese paste. I was getting small knocks but no real takes.

So, perhaps another change of bait. I put on a lobworm, cast to the farside coverage and sure enough, started to get reasonable knocks. Whilst I told myself to sit on my hands because Chub have a habit of nipping the ends of worms with their lips, I forgot my own advice and struck too early. So, out with another worm. This time I waited a bit longer but then seemed like the fish had taken it so I struck into the following Perch - a fish of 1lb 10oz: -

I was pleased with this Perch. One of the biggest that I have caught for some time. So it looked like today may be the day of the predators.

**Long hard slog**
Despite alternating baits, the hot sunny weather and low-clear river combination was wearing me down. No bites. I did start to notice that the flow was picking up. Also, there was more rubbish coming down the river, catching in my farside lines. I could see that the level was also rising very slightly. After a while it became tricky to fish the farside due to the increased flow and the flotsam snagging in my lines. I decided on an ealier than normal finish today - 3:30pm would do it. That gave me about 40 minutes to go. I decided to finish by fishing worm near my upstream/nearside bush and worm to my right (downstream) but just this side of the main flow.

**Time to go - or is it?**
With about 15 minutes to go I pulled up my keepnet and let the Perch go. I decided to give the net 15 minutes to try out in the sun. No sooner had I done that and settled back down when the rod near the upstream bush burst into action. The result was this lovely 3lb 2oz Chub: -

Typical, the main purpose of the keepnet it to prevent a returned Chub from spooking the swim (they are reknowned for doing that). Should I put the net back in or just give it another hour or so to see if I can catch another? I decided to put the Chub straight back and leave the net drying in the sun.

So, another hour. I decided to try 4-5 casters on my size 8 hook that was being fished downstream, just my side of the main flow. This technique caught me my 1st Barbel on the Ure so worth a try. No Barbel but I noticed that my tip never stopped tapping away. There are lots of small fish nipping at those casters.

**I wonder...**
I decided to go down to a lighter hook length with a size 14 hook and fish 2 casters. I wanted to see what was attacking my bait. I also swapped my ledger for a 2 swan-shot link. I still had 8lb main line so this would not be a fair fight but, should a bigger fish take the bait, I was still prepared. I also wanted to prove that I could still catch small fish in quick succession.

Dace - all the way down! Using the lighter setup I kept my rod in my hand because the Dace started to hit the casters as soon as they hit the water. They followed it all the way down to the river bed. My tip never stopped knocking. Hitting the bites was another matter but I did manage quite a few of varied sizes. This was enjoyable but, to be honest, I was hoping a larger fish would join the party but that's maybe something for another day.

**Time to go again - or is it?**
My extra hour was almost passed and, right on cue, my worm was taken by another Chub. This was smaller at about 1.5lb. However it was most appreciated and meant that I now needed to fish an extra 30 minutes - just in case ;-)

Eventually I decided to call it a day. I had caught a 10lb Pike, 1lb 10oz Perch, 2 Chub and probably around 15-20 Dace. Considering the conditions I was quite happy with this but still long for a daytime session that produces more Chub and Barbel action. For now, evenings seem the best bet.
