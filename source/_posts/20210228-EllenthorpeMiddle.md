*Level 9.8m*

**Lovely Day - eventually**
The weather has been much nicer as of late. However, we have had a ground frost for the past couple of nights. There hasn't been any rain for the past few days so the level is near normal and the clarity is improving. It was frosty when I awoke but there was no fog. By the time I had got my gear together and had breakfast, a thickish fog appeared. This fog was not forecast (until tomorrow) but hung around until about 11:30 so kept the temperature down. Once it started to clear, the sun came out and it felt very spring-like. The birds were singing and there was warmth in the sun. In fact, by mid-afternoon, I was sat without my coat or fleece and it was very pleasant.

**Two lines**
After the tentative Perch bites of last week, I decided to go down from a 4oz to a 2oz tip. I therefore fished that rod close into a downstream bush and the other rod out into mid-river. I intended to use a small blockend feeder on both rods putting a mixture of liquidised bread and chopped worm close in and a mixture of groundbait and chopped worm mid river.

**Nothing in fog**
I had no real bites until the fog had gone. Then, in mid-river, I started to get twitches on lobworm tail. I did not strike the first few but then decided to hit the next one and got a lovely fat Perch of 1lb 9oz. I ended up with two Perch and a Roach but these were all very shy bites in mid river.

On the close-in line I alternated between worm, punched bread, cheesepaste and lobworm. I did get a bite on bread but missed it. Other than that, nothing happened on that line.
