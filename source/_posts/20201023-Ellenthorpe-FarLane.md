**Another Exploratory Bream Session**
I fished the far lane at Ellenthorpe in the hope of locating a Bream shoal. I fished 2 rods with groundbait feeder on both rods. I fished lob worm on one rod and trout pellet on the other. I was surpised at how relatively shallow the water was in this area - much shallower that the mioddle lane stretch.

I fished all day for a single bite and was surprised that this 4.5lb Chub fell to lobworm when I was expecting Bream.
