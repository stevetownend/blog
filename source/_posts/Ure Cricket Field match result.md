The club held a match on the Cricket Field stretch of the river. I had a ride out to see how they got on.

The match was one with just over 5lb consisting of small fish although one or two nice Dace and Perch.

One guy had a Barbel on his 2nd cast but it took him straight into a snag and got away.

Another guy had a Chub of over 3lb and lost 2 or 3 others that all snagged him up on the bush that he was forced to fish tight against - couldn't get a bite otherwise.

That spurred me onto a session with only big baits. See my next posting.
