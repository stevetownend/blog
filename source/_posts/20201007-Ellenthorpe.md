**Tue 6th, River falling fast**

***Level 10.5m and falling.***

The river was falling fast since its very high level on Sunday. I have heard that the Ure fishes better when falling rather than the norm which is to fish better when rising (for Barbel). I was therefore keen to head out again to peg 25 for a couple of hours after work.

I decided to fish both rods on the halibut pellet and PVA mesh bags. One almost straight out in front and one downstream, both between 3/4 across and the far side. 

**Quick fish - lost!**'
I got a bite on my downstream rod after about 25 minutes (around 5pm) and hit into a Barbel that seemed relatively calm. That is, until it got near to the surface. It then lunged down and I could not stop it's run into the depths just in front of me. After a few seconds my line snapped. Upon inspection, about 5 - 6m of line had suffered major abrasion. I suspect the Barbel took me through an underwater bush/tree before snapping me. So, I discarded that line and set up again. 

**Missed bite**
Around 5:30pm it started to rain so I began to put up my brolly. The Barbel must have been watching as that was a stimulus for my downstream rod to go again. I managed to get to it and struck, fully expecting to connect with the fish but there was nothing there - arghhh!

**Tap tap tap**
From about 6:15pm until dark (7pm), I was getting taps and little pulls on both rods. These tended to happen after I twitched the bait a bit. None of these turned into hittable bites. Whilst I had not banked any fish tonight, I really enjoyed it because the Barbel were around and I felt that I had found another good stretch after my very unproductive September.

I have also ordered a 17ft float rod so that I can have a few float sessions and hopefully get some nice Roach, Chub, Perch and maybe Bream. It is very deep at Ellenthorpe so the long rod should really help.

**Wed 7th, River almost normal**

***Level 9.8m and falling slightly.***

I was still full of expectation from my previous evening so could not resist another couple of hours in peg 25. When I got there I could see signs of someone else having been in the peg but then noticed that the overhanging bush/tree had been cut back a bit. So I was not sure if it was a fisherman or a working party preparing for Sunday's match. I decided to fish peg 25 anyway.

Despite my heightened expectations I did not get any signs of fish until about 6pm. I then got little taps on both rods but no firm bites. Again, this was after twitching the bait a bit.

I decided to pack up at 7pm (a few mins earlier than my previous visits). However, at 6:55pm my upstream rod bent over and I hit into a very hard fighting Barbel. After a good scrap I landed this lovely 9lb 10oz fish: -

It is interesting that this fish also has a nick in the top of it's tail fin. I have now had 3 fish with similar nicks (2 of them were similar weights so could have been the same fish).
