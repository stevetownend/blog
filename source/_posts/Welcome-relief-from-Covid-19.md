# Angling resumes in England
I recently moved to Boroughbridge specifically to be near a North Yorkshire river and to spend time out on the river banks enjoyimng the wildlife and the angling. I moved in just at the tail end of the terrible floods that we experienced in the 2019/2020 winter. This also coincided with the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown in the UK. Consequently I have not had chance to go fishing or even get to know the town (pubs, cafes, shops etc).

As of two weeks ago, the gradual relaxation of lockdown allowed angling to resume. The river fishing season will be starting on the 16th June and I am really looking forward to that. I have spent quite a bit of time looking down from the nearby bridge at the spawning Chub and Barbel in the low-clear water and it heightens the anticipation for the season ahead.

Since the relaxation in lockdown I have been to a local lake three times and caught some big Bream on both float and feeder fishing tactics along with a recently stocked Mirror Carp of about 3 lb. The lake has quite a few lilly pads that are just breaking the surface so I expect that it will look stunning in the summertime - I just hope they don't take over the whole lake. The Boroughbridge Angling Club have invested a lot of effort and expense by treating the lillies (to reduce them), installing an Otter fence around the lake and stocking some Carp. So far it appears to have paid off and I am looking forward to seeing how the lake develops over the coming years.

Here are few pictures from the lake: -
