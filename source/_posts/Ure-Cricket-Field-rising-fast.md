**Worth a try, nearly in flood**

Saw that the level was rising today so thought it worth a try in the evening. Fished peg 3 and water was already 1.5m up. It continued to rise at about a foot per hour. Tried meat, halibut pellets and cheese. No bites. Lost a few weights of the 1.3oz size. Good thing is that they held bottom ok and even the lightest barbel rod tip seemed ok.

Gonna try again on Tue and Wed morning. Hopefully level will have dropped by then and more manageable.
