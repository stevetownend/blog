**My plan**
I was going to Headingley to watch cricket this evening. I therefore got up early and planned to fish with my seatbox mid-river in peg 12. I would fish the bomb rods with luncheon meat until 9am-ish and then switch to the stick float.

**Bomb rods**
I started fishing around 5:30am. I had my fist bite at 6:20 when a Barbel took my meat and headed off downstream. When I managed to turn it, I was suprised that it headed for the far side bushes (which we actually quite close as I was mid-river). Barbel usually stay mid-river. Unfortunately it snagged me up in the bushes and slipped the hook. Still, it was great to do battle with a strong fish when sat on my seat mid-river.

I did not get any more indications.

**Stick float**
I put on a fairly light stick float and enjoyed instant action with bites almost every trot through. I got several Dace and small Chublets. After a few hours my back was aching so decided to go back on the bomb rod with worm. I get several taps and twitches but no hittable bites.
