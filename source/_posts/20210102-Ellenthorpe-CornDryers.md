**Chilly Day**
It was supposed to stay dry until lunchtime but the snow started about 9:30am and persisted on and off most of the day. 

I was hoping for some Chub but tried lobworm, cheese paste and breadflake all to no avail.

Early afternoon I got one bite from this nice Perch on lobworm.

Nothing else happened and I decided to pack up before it got dark. However I lost my footing and slipped in the mud and, whilst trying to regain my grip, noticed that my tip shot around but, by the time I got to it, the fish had reached cover and snagged me up. I suspect it was a Chub and just typical that it waited (as they so often do) until I was pre-occupied!
