**Long day at Ellenthorpe**
Went into 1st entrace, parked near corn dryers.

Fished to the left (downstream) of the gate. Went just around the corner where it narrowed. Had a gap in farside trees opposite me.

Mid river was about 13ft deep and slow flowing.

Fished from 6:30 until 21:00. Had one bite that resulted in one Roach. This was to a maggot on a Dave Harrell 5g Avon float. Never had a knock on feeder on either far side on near pilings on near side. Only tried large baits on feeder.

Saw several Salmon swirling and even leaping.

A small Pike attacked my keepnet and latched onto the Roach. I had to force the Pike off my net. The Roach died later.
