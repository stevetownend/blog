I don't generally set targets for pleasure fishing but, having moved to Boroughbridge for the fishing, it seems only right that I set myself some objectives. That will encourage me to experiment with baits (e.g. cheese paste, slugs etc) and techniques (e.g. roving, touch ledgering etc). Also, some sessions may be quite short with little tackle but aimed directly at a specific target.

Some of these targets may take years to achieve but it will be interesting to be able to look back on my journey.

The *Details* column may be a link to the blog write-up of that session (where appropriate). It is best viewed in landscape when using a phone.
