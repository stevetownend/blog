# Who am I and why do I blog?

# Steve Townend
I am a proud father of three wonderful children and three grandchildren. I live in a small town called Boroughbridge on the River Ure in North Yorkshire. I now live alone with my dog *Marla*, a loyal German Shepherd cross.

I created this blog to collect my thoughts on two very different aspects of my life. The word "Fish" in the blog title refers to my life-long passion for Angling and a more recent passion for Scuba Diving. The word "Chips" in the title refers to my professional passion for all things computer related, primarly software development.
