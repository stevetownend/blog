# Steve Townend
![Ready for a dive in Malta](/images/SteveTownend.jpg)

I live in a small town called Boroughbridge on the River Ure in North Yorkshire. I live with my dog *Marla*, a loyal German Shepherd cross.
I have three wonderful children and three grandchildren (at the last count). 

I created this blog to collect my thoughts on two very different aspects of my life. The word "Fish" in the blog title refers to my life-long passion for Angling and a more recent passion for Scuba Diving. The word "Chips" refers to my professional and hobbyist passion for all things computer related, primarly software development.
