**Try again on a falling river**

The river is falling and is about 2 feet overdepth so an early start is the order of the day.

Got up at 3:30am and left the house at 4am. Fished peg 11 and slipped down the last part of the bank resulting in me being sat in a muddy puddle - note to self; buy a small trench spade!

I was expecting to fish just out from the small bush that should be downstream of me. However I could not see it so assumed it was still submerged.

I started with half a dozen bait-droppers of a mix of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets, 2mm diced meat and 2mm diced cheddar. I fished meat, lobworms and halibut pellets over the loose feed but not a bite.

I did not have a signal so was unable to check the dog via the internal camera. However about 6am I got a signal and she appeared calm, laid on the sofa but was howling like a wolf every 30 seconds or so. I have seen her do that before but she usually stops after 1 or 2 howls but not this time. I was concerned about her disturbing the neighbours so paked up quickly and was home for 6:30 - dog was fine so back to bed after another blank session.

Later in the morning I went to apologise to the neighbours but they hadn't heard a thing. From now on I will fish daytime or evening when there is less chance of her waking anyone should she howl again.

I also had a look on Amazon and got myself this trench spade. At 40cm long and fairly lightweight, its just the job for slippery river banks: -
